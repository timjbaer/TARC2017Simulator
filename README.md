# TARC2017Simulator
This Wolfram notebook simulates the flight of mid-power rockets and predicts their 2017 TARC score. It was developed on the Wolfram Development Platform.

This project was developed during the 2016 summer and served as my first foray into programming. Before this project, the only experince I had was True Basic in my freshman and sophmore high school math classes.

* It seems that the default parameters need adjusting to ouput a "nice" simulation.
