# TARC2017Simulator
This Wolfram notebook simulates the flight of mid-power rockets and predicts their 2017 TARC score. It was originally developed on the Wolfram Development Platform. I originally concieved of it as an open source and more accurate alternative to RocketSim. Using the Wolfram Language's built-in differential equation solvers, the simulator can be customized up to any accuracy/precision tolerances. However, this simulator requires a lot of measurements about rocket, some of which are not available for commerical parts. RockSim's "parts" interface is much more intuitive and easier to use.

I developed this project during the 2016 summer and it served as my first foray into programming. Previously, the only experince I had was in True Basic for my freshman and sophomore high school math classes.
